# Mosa3ada (Call For Contribution)

The purpose of this project is to identify who needs help after the earthquake in Morocco.

How can I help?
this project is split into many milestones so we need to build it step by step. I've included for you below the goal and the iterations. You can also check the issues in the repo and start working on one of them. Feel free to add a suggestion or a feedback or bug.

 
#### Iteration 1:
The goal of this iteration is to have a listing with the needs,the location, and also a confirm an action to give to others the possibility to confirm a need. The count will help.


#### Iteration 2:
The goal of this iteration we will ad the Google map services to make the app more accessible and also the users can add a new listing directly.
